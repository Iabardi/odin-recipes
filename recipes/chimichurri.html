    <h2>The only Seasoning you need</h2>
    <p>Have you ever made a chimichurri sauce? It's an <strong>Argentinean</strong> sauce or condiment, similar to pesto, that is popular throughout South America. This basic version uses fresh parsley, oregano, garlic, oil and vinegar and a little bit of chili pepper, though the variations on this theme are endless.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup firmly packed fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves</li>
        <li>3 to 4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves (can sub 2 teaspoons dried oregano)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red or white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop the parsley, fresh oregano, and garlic (or process in a food processor several pulses). Place in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>AStir in the olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Adjust seasonings.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately or refrigerate. If chilled, return to room temperature before serving. Can keep for a week or two.</li>
